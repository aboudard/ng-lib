# NgLib

This project is an Angular workspace with a simple library.
The library is supposed to be published on a npm like repo and using the app build, see what happens when angular cache is enabled and the version number of the library doesn't change.

The summary of this experiment can be found [in this article](https://dev.to/this-is-angular/using-angular-cache-with-library-1p96).
